# Self Assessment for Final Project

## Self-Assessment:
My contribution to the project had varies role between Tringle with writing code for Unsupervised ML Cluster Model and Supervised ML Random Forest & Ada Boost Models, and as Circle role supporting teammates in joining tables in SQL database or extracting files from AWS into Google Colab to transform into a functional dataframe that was loaded in PostgreSQL.

## Team Assessment:
The team did a wonderful job with Zoom meetings nearly every night between classes and on the weekends giving up their time with family to complete a final project. If we weren't in a Zoom meeting were always communicated through Slack let everyone know what results or changes have been made along with a friendly reminder to do a GitPull to stay current with changes. 

This team never held back on discussion and when the project hit a fork in the road, the pros and cons were weighed out and a group decision was made to keep things on track and moving forward. At all times everyones input was alway valued and critical thinking for step made the project easy for us to stay on task and complete the final project goal line.

## Summary of Project:
The final project select by our team members was to analyze the internet quality and availability in Kansas based on rural or urban areas. The process of using Maching Learning with Random Forest and R-script helped us determine our team's results. With the findings and analysis discoveries we were able to determine the number of Internet Service Provider (ISP) and average download speeds per Kansas county, average download speeds are general equal by rural or urban but was able to show that rural areas have 60% with zero ISP.
